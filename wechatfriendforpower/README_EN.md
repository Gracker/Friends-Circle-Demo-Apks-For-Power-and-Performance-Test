# Friend Circle Power Consumption Testing Module

This module is specifically designed to test the power consumption of Android applications during scrolling and interaction, aiming to help developers understand how different implementations affect battery consumption.

*阅读[中文版](README.md)*

## Features

- **Precise Power Consumption Testing**:
  - Providing power consumption comparisons for different UI implementation approaches
  - Simulating power consumption in real user usage scenarios
  
- **Stable Test Conditions**:
  - Using fixed test data and UI structure
  - Ensuring each test is conducted under the same conditions for easy comparison
  
- **Comprehensive Test Scenarios**:
  - Power consumption during scrolling
  - Power consumption during static display
  - Power consumption during image loading

## How to Use

1. Run the application and enter the power consumption testing interface
2. Collect data using Android battery statistics or professional power consumption testing tools
3. Test in different usage scenarios, such as:
   - Fast scrolling of the list
   - Slow browsing of content
   - Viewing images
4. Analyze the collected power consumption data and compare differences between implementation approaches

## Implementation Details

- Efficient list display based on RecyclerView
- Optimized image loading strategy to reduce unnecessary loading and memory consumption
- Using caching mechanisms to reduce object creation and lower GC pressure
- Streamlined layout hierarchy to reduce overdraw

## Balance with Performance

While optimizing power consumption, it's necessary to maintain good performance:

- Reducing CPU and GPU usage can lower power consumption but should not affect scrolling smoothness
- Lowering image loading quality can reduce power consumption but needs to maintain visual quality
- Reducing animations and special effects can save power but should maintain good user experience

## Relationship with Main Project

This is a submodule of the [High Performance WeChat Friend Circle Demo](../README_EN.md), focusing on power consumption testing. The project also includes the original implementation module and performance testing module.
